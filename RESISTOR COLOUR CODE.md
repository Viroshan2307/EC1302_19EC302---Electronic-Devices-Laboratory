# RESISTOR COLOUR CODE

## AIM: 

To learn Resistor Colour Code and to determine the stated value of a resistor by interpreting the colour code indicated on the resistor. 

 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED

Resistors – 5 No’s.


## THEORY
The colour bands on the body of the resistor tell how much resistance it has. As shown in the following diagrams figure (1), there is a 4-band resistors. The 4-band resistors, the last band indicates tolerance in table (1). Consult with the “Resistor colour codes and Resistor Tolerance” in table (2) chart for finding the tolerance value.
The first letter word to represent color resistor code in table (1)

View the resistors and based on the color bands determine its value. Below is an example:

The first band is a one (1), the second band is a zero (0), and the multiplier band or third band is one time text to the third power (103) or one thousand (1000). Multiply 10  times 1000.
Determine the value and tolerance of the 10 resistors as shown in the following tables for chart fig. (3):
